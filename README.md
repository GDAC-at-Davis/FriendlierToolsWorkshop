# Intro to Tools Development Workshop
### A GDAC Workshop introducing game engine editor tooling! (Spring Quarter, 4/16/2024)

This Unity project is the activity portion of the workshop.

1.  After starting the project, open the scenes in the folder labeled "Edit Me!"
2. Each scene is an incomplete level, with notes left by the previous designer on their goals. Use the prefabs provided to finish designing the level!
3. However, designing with no visual aids is tricky business, so you'll have to dive into the scripts and add your own to aid in the design process!
4. Design, Improve the tools, iterate, repeat!
