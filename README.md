# Intro to Tools Development Workshop
A GDAC Workshop introducing game engine editor tooling!
Held Spring Quarter 4/16/2024

This is the project used for the workshop activity. After starting the project, open the scenes in the folder labeled "Edit Me!"

Each scene is an incomplete level, with notes left by the previous designer on their goals. Use the prefabs provided to finish designing the level!
However, designing with no visual aids is tricky business, so you'll have to dive into the scripts and add your own to aid in the design process!

and

for reference!

Made with Unity 2022.3.21f1
